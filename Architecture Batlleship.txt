"Hard" difficulty algorithm:
- picks random square to hit
- if miss, pick other random square but never the same square
- if hit, memorise hit square location
- hits the 4 adjacent squares in order up, left, down, right (at corners and edges only hit the 2 or 3 available squares
- if hit, continue down the line determined by the two hit squares in initial direction (if up hits, continue up ; if left hits, continue left)
- if miss and ship is not destroyed, hit squares in the opposite direction of 2nd hit until ship is destroyed then delete initial hit location
- else delete initial hit location
